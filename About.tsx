        I am a passionate learner with a background of M.Sc in Marine Biology and over a decade of teaching experience. Currently, I am exploring the world of web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My goal is to build dynamic and user-friendly applications that can make a positive impact on users&apos; lives. I am dedicated to continuous improvement, always looking for new ways to enhance my skills and knowledge. My approach to learning is hands-on, allowing me to effectively grasp concepts and apply them in real-world scenarios. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share my insights and learn from others.
